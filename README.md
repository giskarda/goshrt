#goshrt

trivial implementation of a go/<keyword> bookmark web service in GO. (pun intended)

If you control the 'dns' internal network you can create a dns domain:

go.$your.$internal.$domain

By leveraging the autocomplete dns name feature of the OS (appending the 'domain' value of /etc/hosts) you can use the tool
like 

http://go/coding-standards

or

http://go/company-policy

or whatever is good to have a simple URL.
